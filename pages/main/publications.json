Coastal degradation can be identified, visualized and estimated through periodic monitoring over a region of interest using earth observation, climate, meteorological, seasonal, waves, sea level rising, and other ocean- and maritime-related datasets. Usually, these datasets are provided through different sources, in different structures or data types; in many cases, a complete dataset can be large in size and needs some kind of preprocessing (information filtering) before use in the intended application. Recently, the term data cube introduced in the scientific community and frameworks like Google Earth Engine and Open Data Cubes have emerged as a solution to earth observation data harmonization, federation, and exchange framework; however, these sources either completely lack the ability to process climate, meteorological, waves, sea lever rising, etc., data from open sources, like CORDEX and WCRP, or preprocessing is required. This study describes and utilizes the Ocean-DC framework for modular earth observation and other data types to resolve major big data challenges. Compared to the already existing approaches, the Ocean-DC framework harmonizes several types of data and generates ready-to-use data cubes products, which can be merged together to produce high-dimensionality visualization products. To prove the efficiency of the Ocean-DC framework, a case study at Crete Island, emphasizing the Port of Heraklion, demonstrates the practical utility by revealing degradation trends via time-series analysis of several related remote sensing indices calculated using the Ocean-DC framework. The results show a significant reduction in processing time (up to 89%) compared to traditional remote sensing approaches and optimized data storage management, proving its value as a scalable solution for environmental resilience, highlighting its potential use in early warning systems and decision support systems for sustainable coastal infrastructure management.},\nDOI = {10.3390/jmse13071239}\n}",

A key aspect of sustainable urban planning is decentralizing and democratizing its processes, which requires citizen involvement from the early design stages. While current solutions such as digital tools, participatory workshops, gamification, and social media can enhance participation, they often exclude non-experts or those lacking digital skills. To address these limitations, this manuscript proposes a VR/AR gamified solution using open-source software and open GIS data. Specifically, it investigates the euPOLIS game as an innovative participatory tool offering an alternative to traditional approaches. This game decentralizes urban planning by shifting technical tasks to experts while citizens engage interactively, focusing solely on proposing solutions. To explore the potential of the proposed methodology, the euPOLIS game was demonstrated as a workshop activity in TNOC 2024 Festival, where 30 individuals from different academic background (i.e., citizens, architects, planners, etc.) voluntarily engaged and provided their impressions and feedback. The findings suggest that gamified solutions such as serious/simulation AR/VR games can effectively promote co-design, co-participation, and co-creation in urban planning in an inclusive and engaging manner.},\nDOI = {10.3390/smartcities8020044}\n}",

A solution to this problem can be the periodic monitoring over critical areas, like coastal region with heavy industrial activity (i.e., ship-buildings) or areas where a disaster (i.e., oil-spill) has occurred. Today there are several Earth and non-Earth Observation data available from several data providers. These data are huge in size and usually it is needed to combine several data from multiple sources (i.e., data with format differences) for a more effective evaluation. For addressing these issues, this work proposes the Ocean-DC framework as a solution in data harmonization and homogenization. A strong advantage of this Data Cube implementation is the generation of a single NetCDF product that contains Earth Observation data of several data types (i.e., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Ocean-DC implementation, it is examined a case study of an oil-spill in Saronic gulf in September of 2017. The generated 4D Data Cube considers both Landsat-8,9 and Sentinel-2 products for a time-series analysis, before, during, and after the oil-spill event. The Ocean-DC framework successfully generated a NetCDF product, containing all the necessary remote sensing products for monitoring the oil-spill disaster in the Saronic gulf.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments},\npages = {412–419},\nnumpages = {8},\nkeywords = {Climate Change, Coastal Areas, Data Cubes},\nlocation = {Crete, Greece},\nseries = {PETRA '24}\n}\n",

The heterogeneous spread of the pandemic within EU regions elicited a wide range of policies, such as school closure, transport restrictions, etc. However, the implementation of these interventions is not accompanied by the implementation of quantitative methods, which would indicate their effectiveness. As a result, the efficacy of such policies on reducing the spread of the virus varies significantly. This paper investigates the effectiveness of using deep learning paradigms to accurately model the spread of COVID-19. The deep learning approaches proposed in this paper are able to effectively map the temporal evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak, while simultaneously taking into account policy interventions directly into the modelling process. Thus, our approach facilitates data-driven decision making by utilizing previous knowledge to train models that predict not only the spread of COVID-19, but also the effect of specific policy measures on minimizing this spread. Global models at the EU level are proposed, which can be successfully applied at the national level. These models use various inputs in order to successfully model the spatio-temporal variability of the phenomenon and obtain generalization abilities. The proposed models are compared against the traditional epidemiological and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.},\nDOI = {10.3390/s22103658}\n}",

To reduce the transmissibility of the new virus, the local authorities, worldwide, introduced a series of measures to flatten the curve. Many of the measures included some form of lockdown and movement restrictions. This unique coordinated worldwide reaction, created an opportunity for researching the effects of low traffic in air quality. In this work we research the relation between the COVID-19 measures and the Air Quality Index (AQI), using four pollutant gases (CO, O3, NO2, SO2). Also, we used a variety of machine learning tools (DNN, DTR, K-NN, Lasso, LReg, MAdam, MGBR, RFR, Ridge) to estimate the accuracy of each method in the prediction of the concentration for each gas one week later. The results showed that after the strict COVID-19 restriction measures the concentration of each pollutant gas reduced rapidly and increased again after the relaxation of lockdown measures. Finally in cases like Australia, where the measures weren’t as strict as other countries, no improvement observed.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 14th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference},\npages = {396–403},\nnumpages = {8},\nkeywords = {neural networks, machine learning, environmental quality, COVID-19},\nlocation = {Corfu, Greece},\nseries = {PETRA '21}\n}",

In particular, we emphasize on the concentration effects regarding specific pollutant gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). The assessment of the impact of lockdown on air quality focused on four European Cities (Athens, Gladsaxe, Lodz and Rome). Available data on pollutant factors were obtained using global satellite observations. The level of the employed prevention measures is employed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. The second part of the analysis employed a variety of machine learning tools, utilized for estimating the concentration of each pollutant, two days ahead. The results showed that a weak to moderate correlation exists between the corresponding measures and the pollutant factors and that it is possible to create models which can predict the behaviour of the pollutant gases under daily human activities.}\n}",

The application scenario involved data sequences from Greek traditional dances. In particular, a visualization application interface was developed allowing the user to load the C3D sequences, edit the data and remove possible noise. The interface was developed using the OpenGL language and is able to parse aby C3D format file. The interface is supported by several functionalities such as a pre-processing of the 3D point data and noise removal of 3D points that fall apart from the human skeleton. The main research innovation of this paper is the use of a deep machine learning framework through which human skeleton can be extracted. The points are selected on the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Experimental results on real-life dances being captured by the Vicon motion capturing system are presented to show the great performance of the proposed scheme.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-030-11935-5\"\n}",
